    <p>Hi all!</p>

<p>Thanks for volunteering to be a part of Sourcery.info, the project that’ll make it safe to use AI with your documents. I typically work on Sourcery on Mondays, so from now on I’m going to write a short update on Mondays on how things are progressing, what help I need, and to solicit your feedback and opinions. It’ll also help keep me working at pace - I don’t want to get to the end of Monday and have nothing new to say!</p>

<p>I’ve broken ground on development. I started with some mockups, and have now moved on to some simple user interfaces, as well as experimenting with AI models. As soon as I have a working prototype, I will get it into your hands to try! I’m hoping this’ll happen in the next six weeks.</p>

<p>I’ve been running the AI models on my Macbook Pro M1 with 16GB of RAM, and the performance isn’t great, especially for a half-capable model like Llama2. It takes an age to index large documents, and the performance while chatting to them isn’t what I’d consider acceptable at this point.</p>

<p>I do have a plan though - today I experimented with doing some of the heavy lifting on a cloud computer, and even on the lowest tier computer it was significantly faster. I’ve rearchitected Sourcery so that this is an option for you. If you’re dealing with less-sensitive documents, like court reports or government documents, use the cloud solution and save yourself a bunch of time and expense. It’ll still be relatively secure and significantly more private than the publicly available AI systems from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google etc.</p>

<p>If you’re working on some kind of Snowden-leaks or Panama Papers, and everything needs to be super-secure, then you can still run everything securely and locally, but you might need to purchase a beefy machine for the task.</p>

<p>The good news is that the cost of a very AI-capable machine is coming down quickly, and PCs are getting much faster at AI. I predict that by the end of this year, a new mid-tier machine will be quite able to run a decent model at an acceptable speed.</p>

<p>In light of this, I have a few questions for you: 
How much, if at all, do you deal with really sensitive documents?
How much budget would you be able to allocate if you needed a seriously secure environment?
What are the specs of your current every-day machine?</p>

<p>Until next week Monday!</p>
