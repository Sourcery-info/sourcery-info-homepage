Hi all

I’m going to keep it short today: I had my first chat with my own documents, through my own interface. It's slow. It's clunky. It crashes a lot. But it really is a big leap forward and I’m really happy with it. (See attached pic showing off that it is an actual conversation - it remembers what you’re talking about.)

Next I’m working on speed and file management. In a few weeks we should have some videos which I’m hoping will make you lot excited.

Once again, please send me docs for testing and if there’s anyone else you think would like to be involved, please put us in touch.

Have a good week!
